## PROJECTS

### BRAIN TUMOR CLASSIFICATION USING CNN
Developed a brain tumor classification system using CNN architectures (ResNet101, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and EfficientNetB0), with ResNet50 achieving the highest accuracy. ResNet50 was chosen as the base model and deployed using Flask to identify brain tumors. If a tumor is detected, the system displays the tumor type (among three types) and provides recommendations for potential reduction. If no tumor is detected, it simply displays “No tumor”.

### ANOMALY-DETECTION IN VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
Developed a real-time video surveillance system using Python to enhance public safety through face and mask detection. The project combines two modules: Module 1 for face detection, which captures a photo when a face appears and displays a "face detected" label, and Module 2 for mask detection, showing the percentage of mask coverage if worn or prompting users to wear a mask otherwise.

### RESTAURANT REVIEWS CLASSIFICATION USING NLP
Developed a sentiment analysis web application using Streamlit to analyse and visualize sentiment in user-provided text data.
